# IntelSGX Rust Bootstrap

Getting started with [Intel SGX](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads) on Linux and [Rust](https://github.com/baidu/rust-sgx-sdk) with docker is a bit of a pain.

## Optional

- On Ubuntu 18.04 (linux kernel 4.14) install the driver from the [repository directly](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver/issues/50).
- If you have SGX set to software controlled in bios, you can use the [enabler](https://github.com/dzobbe/sgx-sw-enabler-linux).
